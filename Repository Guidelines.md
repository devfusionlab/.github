## Introduction

At DEV FUSION LAB, we value collaboration, quality, and continuous improvement. This repository serves as a central hub for sharing guidelines that help us work effectively together on our projects. Following these guidelines will enhance code consistency, simplify code reviews, and ensure secure and stable software development practices.

## Getting Started

- Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone`.
- Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix. Use a meaningful name for the branch that describes the changes you'll make.
- Make changes, commit frequently, and push your branch to the remote repository.
- Open a pull request (PR) when you are ready for code review and merge.
- Before merging your PR, ensure it passes all necessary checks and tests.

## Branching Strategy

We follow the **Gitflow** branching model for our repositories. The main branches are:

- `main`: Represents the production-ready code. Only merge stable and reviewed code here.
- `develop`: Serves as the development branch, where all features and bug fixes are integrated before being promoted to `main`.
- Feature branches: Created from `develop` and used for developing new features or making changes to existing ones.
- Bug fix branches: Created from `develop` to address bugs found in the `main` branch.

Please ensure that each pull request is targeted to the appropriate branch, and keep the branches up to date with the latest changes from `develop`.

## Pull Requests

- Submit a pull request (PR) for code review when your feature or bug fix is ready.
- Provide a clear and concise title and description for your PR, explaining the changes made.
- The PR should reference any related issues using the GitHub issue number, e.g., "Fixes #123."
- Request reviews from relevant team members to ensure timely feedback and approval.

## Naming Conventions

Consistent naming conventions improve code readability and maintainability. Adhere to the following naming conventions in our projects:

- **File Naming**: Use descriptive and meaningful names for files, and follow the appropriate file extensions for the programming language used (e.g., `.js` for JavaScript, `.py` for Python).
- **Variable Naming**: Use clear and descriptive names for variables. Avoid single-letter variable names unless they have a specific meaning in the context.
- **Function Naming**: Follow camelCase for function names, starting with a lowercase letter, and use descriptive names that indicate the function's purpose.
- **Class Naming**: Use PascalCase for class names, starting with an uppercase letter, and use descriptive names that represent the class's role.
- **Constant Naming**: Use uppercase letters with underscores to name constants, providing a clear indication of their immutability.


## Repository Naming Conventions

When creating GitHub repositories, use meaningful names that reflect the project's purpose, context, and technology. Follow the naming conventions below to ensure clarity and consistency across your organization.

### Front-end Repositories

- **Category**: Include the general category of the front-end project.

- **Example**: `ecommerce-frontend`, `blog-frontend`, `portfolio-frontend`.

### Backend Repositories

- **Category**: Include the general category of the backend project.

- **Example**: `ecommerce-backend`, `blog-backend`, `user-authentication-backend`.

### Service or Microservice Repositories

- **Category**: Include the specific service or microservice represented by the repository.

- **Example**: `payment-service`, `notification-service`, `user-authentication-service`.

### Shared Libraries or Modules

- **Category**: For repositories that contain shared code libraries or modules.

- **Example**: `utils-library`, `common-components`, `data-access-module`.


## Code Style and Formatting

Consistent code style makes it easier to read, maintain, and collaborate on code. We use a consistent code style across all projects, and we follow the style guides appropriate for the programming languages and technologies used.

- For JavaScript, we use the [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript).
- For Python, we use the [PEP 8 Style Guide](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).

Use code formatters and linters to ensure adherence to the style guides.

## Issue Tracking

We use GitHub Issues for bug tracking, feature requests, and task management. When creating an issue, use the provided templates to provide relevant information, including steps to reproduce the bug or a detailed description of the new feature.

## Code Review

Code reviews are essential for maintaining code quality. All code changes should go through a review process before being merged into the `develop` or `main` branches.

- Reviewers should provide constructive feedback and suggestions for improvement.
- Address review comments and iterate on the code until it meets the required standards.

## Continuous Integration

We employ continuous integration (CI) to automate the build, test, and deployment process. CI helps catch errors early and maintain a stable codebase.

- CI pipelines should include automated tests and checks for coding standards.
- Ensure that your branch passes all CI checks before submitting a PR.

## Security

Security is a top priority for us. Follow secure coding practices and be cautious of any security vulnerabilities.

- Never hardcode sensitive information such as passwords or API keys in the code.
- Report any security vulnerabilities or concerns through the appropriate channels.
